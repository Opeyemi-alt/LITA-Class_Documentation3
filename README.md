### Project Title: Power BI Data Analysis and Visualization
---
### Objective:

Develop skills in Power BI to transform, analyze, and visualize data, applying power query, expression functions, table functions, matrix functions, conditional columns, calculated columns, and measures.

### Scope:
---
Power Query:

1. Data transformation (filtering, grouping, sorting)
2. Merging data (inner join, left join, right join)
3. Data cleansing (handling nulls, duplicates)


Table Functions:

1. Table filtering (FILTER, ALL)
2. Table grouping (GROUPBY)
3. Table summarization (SUMMARIZE)

Matrix Functions:

1. Matrix visualization
2. Row and column configuration

Conditional Columns:

1. IF statements
2. Conditional formatting

Calculated Columns:

1. Arithmetic operations
2. Date and time calculations
3. Text manipulation

Measures:

1. Calculated fields
2. Aggregations (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT)
3. Data modeling

### Class Activities:
---

1. Text Cleaning
2. Sales analysis dashboard
3. Customer segmentation report
4. Product inventory management
5. Regional sales performance

### Learning Outcomes:
---

1. Efficient data transformation and merging
2. Effective use of expression functions
3. Table and matrix function application
4. Conditional and calculated column creation
5. Measure development for data analysis

### Tools and Software:
---

- Power BI Desktop
- Excel

### Deliverables:
---

1. Completed exercise files
2. Power BI reports and dashboards
3. Written reflections on learning outcomes
